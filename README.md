Abstractï¼š
A distributed neural network model with embedded physical information (DTPI) algorithm is proposed for the estimation of meter error and line loss where charging order data and the law of conservation of energy are employed. You can learn more details in DOI: .
Code:
The file 'test1030_BestRessult.py' is the main function, where the FeatureRegress is been used for regress the data between Bill and Vehicle.
THIS NOTICE THAT 'feed_sample.npy' is the data that have benn pre-process.
And The file 'Physics_BayesNet.py' is the last step to caculate the operating error.
DON'T BE MIND, JUST RUN :)
